## Who It's For

CC Pocket is for people who already rely on coding agents and want an easier way to stay in the loop when they are away from the keyboard.

- **Solo developers running long agent sessions** on a Mac mini, laptop, or dev box
- **Indie hackers and founders** who want to keep shipping while commuting, walking, or away from their desk
- **AI-native engineers** juggling multiple sessions and frequent approval requests
- **Self-hosters** who want their code to stay on their own machine instead of a hosted IDE

If your workflow is "start an agent, let it run, step in only when needed," CC Pocket is built for that.

## Why People Use It

- **Start or resume sessions from your phone** once your Bridge Server is reachable
- **Handle approvals quickly** with a touch-first UI instead of a terminal prompt
- **Watch streaming output live** including plans, tool activity, and agent responses
- **Review diffs more easily** with syntax-highlighted code changes and image diff support
- **Write better prompts** with Markdown, auto-completing bullet lists, and image attachments
- **Track multiple sessions** with project grouping, search, and approval badges
- **Get notified when action is needed** with push notifications for approvals and task completion
- **Connect however you prefer** with saved machines, QR codes, mDNS discovery, or manual URLs
- **Manage a remote Mac over SSH** for start, stop, and update flows when using launchd

## What CC Pocket Can and Can't Do

To set expectations clearly:

| Capability | Supported |
|------------|-----------|
| Start a brand-new Claude Code or Codex session from CC Pocket | `Yes` |
| Reopen and resume a past session from session history stored on your Mac | `Yes` |
| Attach to an already-active session that was started directly on your Mac and keep controlling it live from CC Pocket | `No` |

If you start a session on your Mac outside CC Pocket, you can resume it later from saved history, but CC Pocket does not take over that live session in progress.

## How It Works

1. Install and run the Bridge Server on the machine where Claude Code or Codex CLI is installed.
2. Connect the mobile app to that Bridge Server.
3. Start sessions, answer agent questions, approve tools, and review changes from your phone.

Your coding session stays on your own machine and flows through your own Bridge Server.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install a CLI Provider

Install at least one of these on the host machine:

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)

You also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+.

### 2. Start the Bridge Server

```bash
# Run directly with npx
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest

# Or install globally
npm install -g @ccpocket/bridge
ccpocket-bridge
```

By default, the Bridge Server listens on `ws://0.0.0.0:8765` and prints a QR code you can scan from the app.

Optional health check:

```bash
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest doctor
# or
ccpocket-bridge doctor
```

### 3. Install the Mobile App

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cc-pocket-dev-agent-remote/id6759188790"><img height="40" alt="Download on the App Store" src="docs/images/app-store-badge.svg" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.k9i.ccpocket"><img height="40" alt="Get it on Google Play" src="docs/images/google-play-badge-en.svg" /></a>
</div>

### 4. Connect

| Method | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| **Saved Machines** | Regular use with reconnects, status checks, and favorites |
| **QR Code** | Fastest first-time setup |
| **mDNS Auto-Discovery** | Same-network discovery without typing IPs |
| **Manual Input** | Tailscale, remote hosts, or custom ports |

Examples:

- `ws://192.168.1.5:8765`
- `ws://100.x.y.z:8765` over Tailscale
- `ccpocket://connect?url=ws://IP:PORT&token=API_KEY`

### 5. Start a Session

In the app, choose a project and permission mode, then start a Claude Code or Codex session.

| Permission Mode | Behavior |
|----------------|----------|
| `Default` | Standard interactive mode |
| `Accept Edits` | Auto-approve file edits, ask for everything else |
| `Plan` | Stay in planning mode until you approve execution |
| `Bypass All` | Auto-approve everything |

You can also enable **Worktree** to isolate a session in its own git worktree.

## Worktree Support

When starting a session, you can enable **Worktree** to automatically create a [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) with its own branch and directory. This lets you run multiple sessions in parallel on the same project without conflicts.

### `.gtrconfig` Compatibility

CC Pocket's Bridge Server is partially compatible with the [`.gtrconfig`](https://github.com/coderabbitai/git-worktree-runner?tab=readme-ov-file#team-configuration-gtrconfig) format used by [git-worktree-runner](https://github.com/coderabbitai/git-worktree-runner). If your project has a `.gtrconfig` file, the Bridge Server will use it when creating worktrees.

| Section | Key | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `[copy]` | `include` | Glob patterns for files to copy (e.g. `.env`, config files) |
| `[copy]` | `exclude` | Glob patterns to exclude from copy |
| `[copy]` | `includeDirs` | Directory names to copy recursively |
| `[copy]` | `excludeDirs` | Directory names to exclude |
| `[hooks]` | `postCreate` | Shell command to run after worktree creation |
| `[hooks]` | `preRemove` | Shell command to run before worktree deletion |

**Tip:** Adding `.claude/settings.local.json` to the `[copy] include` list is especially recommended. This carries over your MCP server configuration and permission settings to each worktree session automatically.

<details>
<summary>Example <code>.gtrconfig</code></summary>

```ini
[copy]
# Claude Code settings (MCP servers, permissions, additional directories)
include = .claude/settings.local.json

# Environment-specific config
include = apps/mobile/android/local.properties

# Speed up worktree setup by copying node_modules
includeDirs = node_modules

[hooks]
# Restore Flutter dependencies after worktree creation
postCreate = cd apps/mobile && flutter pub get
```

</details>

## Ideal Use Cases

- **An always-on Mac mini** running the agent while you monitor from your phone
- **A lightweight review loop on the go** where the agent codes and you approve commands or answer questions as needed
- **Parallel sessions across projects** with one mobile inbox for pending approvals
- **Remote personal infrastructure** over Tailscale instead of exposing ports publicly

## Remote Access and Machine Management

### Tailscale

Tailscale is the easiest way to reach your Bridge Server outside your home or office network.

1. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on your host machine and phone.
2. Join the same tailnet.
3. Connect to `ws://<host-tailscale-ip>:8765` from the app.

### Saved Machines and SSH

You can register machines in the app with host, port, API key, and optional SSH credentials.

When SSH is enabled, CC Pocket can trigger these remote actions from the machine card:

- `Start`
- `Stop Server`
- `Update Bridge`

This flow is intended for **macOS hosts using launchd**.

### launchd Setup on macOS

If you want the Bridge Server to run as a managed background service, use the built-in setup command:

```bash
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest setup
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest setup --port 9000 --api-key YOUR_KEY
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest setup --uninstall

# global install variant
ccpocket-bridge setup
```

## Platform Notes

- **Bridge Server**: works anywhere Node.js and your CLI provider work
- **SSH start/stop/update from the app**: macOS host with `launchd` setup
- **Window listing and screenshot capture**: macOS-only host feature
- **Tailscale**: optional, but strongly recommended for remote access

If you want a clean always-on setup, a Mac mini is the best-supported host environment right now.

## Host Configuration for Screenshot Capture

If you want to use screenshot capture on macOS, grant **Screen Recording** permission to the terminal app that runs the Bridge Server.

Without it, `screencapture` can return black images.

Path:

`System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Screen Recording`

For reliable window capture on an always-on host, it also helps to disable display sleep and auto-lock.

```bash
sudo pmset -a displaysleep 0 sleep 0
```
