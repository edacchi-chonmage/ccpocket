# Changelog

All notable changes to `@ccpocket/bridge` will be documented in this file.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- `errorCode` field on error messages for structured client-side display (`auth_login_required`, `auth_token_expired`, `auth_api_error`, `path_not_allowed`)

### Changed
- Auth and path-not-allowed error messages now include clear problem descriptions and remedy instructions (e.g. `claude auth login`) so users can self-resolve without checking server logs
- Dev script unsets `CLAUDECODE` env var to allow E2E testing inside a Claude Code session

## [1.11.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Fall back to macOS Keychain for Claude OAuth credentials when `~/.claude/.credentials.json` does not exist (e.g. login performed on older Claude Code version that stored creds in Keychain)

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Deliver available model lists (Claude / Codex) in `session_list` message so clients can display dynamic dropdowns instead of hardcoded values

### Changed
- Update model lists to latest versions: Claude 4.6 series (opus, sonnet, haiku), Codex gpt-5.4 default

## [1.10.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Restore slash commands on `get_history` after history eviction — long sessions (100+ messages) lost `init`/`supported_commands` from in-memory history, causing slash completion to fall back to 4 built-in commands when re-entering the session
- Protect `system` messages from history eviction alongside `user_input`

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- `BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DIRS` environment variable for project path whitelist (defaults to `$HOME`)
- Path validation on `start`, `resume_session`, `get_diff`, `get_diff_image`, `list_files`, `list_worktrees`, `remove_worktree` — rejects paths outside allowed directories
- Include `allowedDirs` in `session_list` message for client-side path input assistance
- Send `project_history` on WebSocket connect so clients receive history immediately

## [1.9.7] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Auto-refresh expired OAuth access token before starting SDK session (prevents auth errors when token expires between CLI sessions)

## [1.9.6] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Skip system-injected messages (`<local-command-caveat>`, `<local-command-stderr>`, etc.) when extracting firstPrompt/lastPrompt from JSONL scan
- Add streaming fallback for sessions with large user messages (embedded images) that exceed the 16KB head-read buffer
- Supplement missing lastPrompt for Claude sessions via tail-read with growing window (8KB→128KB), enabling distinct Last display mode in session list (+3-5ms overhead)

## [1.9.5] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Replace `claude auth status` process spawn with lightweight file read for auth pre-check (reduces memory pressure)
- Preserve extra credential fields (scopes, subscriptionType, rateLimitTier) when refreshing OAuth tokens

## [1.9.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Read Claude OAuth credentials from disk (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`) instead of macOS Keychain, eliminating iCloudHelper keychain dialog
- Replace keychain-based doctor check with file-based credential check

## [1.9.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Pre-check Claude auth before starting SDK session to prevent macOS keychain access dialog
- Remove password read (-w flag) from doctor's keychain check to avoid triggering keychain dialog
- Preserve original user text when merging SDK echo (avoid overwriting with translated text)

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Include Claude Code model name in session list response (stored from system/init message)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Make Codex sandbox mode switching actually work (destroy + resume with new sandbox parameter)
- Fix 0-message session sandbox switch causing "no rollout found" error
- Always use last turn_context for codex session settings after sandbox mode changes
- Send sandbox mode in external format ("on"/"off") to clients instead of internal format
- Pass sandboxMode to navigation when resuming Codex sessions from session list

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-28

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Add timestamp to `user_input` history entries so client displays original send time

## [1.5.3] - 2026-02-25

- Optimize namedOnly session path to skip unnamed sessions early
- Parallelize Claude + Codex session loading with Promise.all
- Remove messageCount from session index entries to eliminate full-file scanning

## [1.5.2] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Stabilize busy-path queue handling by deriving `input_ack.queued` and interrupt behavior from actual enqueue results
- Ensure busy-path logs are emitted consistently when input is queued and interrupted
- Resolve tool-result image paths relative to project root when CLI outputs project-relative absolute-like paths (e.g. `/images/...`)
- Fix gallery/image persistence failures caused by unresolved screenshot paths

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Replace single-slot `pendingInput` with FIFO array queue to prevent message loss when multiple inputs arrive while the agent is busy
- Auto-interrupt the current agent turn when a new message is queued, so queued messages are picked up promptly instead of waiting for the turn to finish
- Add `queued` flag to `input_ack` response so the client can show a "queued" indicator
- Preserve queued messages across `interrupt()` calls instead of clearing them

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Server-side filtering for `list_recent_sessions`: `provider`, `namedOnly`, and `searchQuery` parameters
